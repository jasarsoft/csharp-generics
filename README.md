# C# Generics
### by Scott Allen

Generics are a powerful feature of the C# language that allow you to create type-safe data structures and APIs. This course will examine generics from every angle. We'll look at the built-in generic collections of the .NET framework, and use generic classes, interfaces, and delegates in building custom collections. There are tips for cleaning up and hiding generic noise from business logic, as well as a thorough demonstration of constraints, covariance, and contravariance in building APIs for a custom repository and inversion of control container.
